			<p>born west of Fort Worth, Texas when people still used VCRs, kyle experienced living in different parts of the country including the Midwest and the southern Rockies. He attended a different school district nearly every year and became confident making friends with people of diverse lifestyles. A passion for fantasy and self-expression developed into a lust for life that began with skateboarding and writing poetry and has not yet finished with building custom motorcycles, machinery design, songwriting, gardening and computer science. kyle chose a life partner from his hometown and they moved together to Washington in 2016. they both enjoy homemaking, reflection in quiet moments, and being present for community when they are not playing video games near their cats together.</p>
